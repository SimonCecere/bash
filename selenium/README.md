# Selenium Provisioner `provision_selenium.sh`

To load up a headless Selenium server in a Vagrant box run the `get_selenium_provisioner.sh` script from where your Vagrant boot up script are located. 
For example with Puphpet this file should be put in the `puphpet/files/startup_once` or `puphpet/files/startup_always` folder to have this run at the end the vagrant boot up process.
